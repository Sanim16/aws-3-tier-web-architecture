## New branch to implement everything with terraform
This branch seeks to implement the whole workshop with only terraform and no manual steps
I might need to add github-actions though.

# aws-3-tier-web-architecture
3 tier web Architecture deployed on AWS with Terraform

This is a terraform implementation of this [workshop](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/85cd2bb2-7f79-4e96-bdee-8078e469752a/en-US)


Note

Some of the infrastructure in this tutorial may not qualify for the AWS [free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all). Destroy the infrastructure at the end of the trial to avoid unnecessary charges. I am not responsible for any charges that you incur.
